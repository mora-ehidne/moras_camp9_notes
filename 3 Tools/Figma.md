# Design systems 

 atlassian and airbnb have public design systems
 
A design system contains all the layout rules, including grids, components, colors, fonts, sizes etc.
A style guide is a subset of a design system.

# Components

A component is an object that appears multiple times in a design.
It can be created from existing elements with the *create component* command
(`option + command + K`).
All elements that are copied from the component are its *instances*, and all changes to the component are reflected in its instances. Changes made to the individual instances stay on the individual instances.
