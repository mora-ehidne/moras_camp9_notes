# JavaScript Object Notation

JSON is a format for storing and transporting data.

JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.

In order to communicate with .json files localy or remote, the JSON object offers two static methods to convert back and forth between a JS object and a JSON string.

# `JSON.parse()`

The `JSON.parse()` method has a single parameter:
1. a JSON string to be converted into a JS object

The function returns an object.

# `JSON.stringify()`

The `JSON.stringify()` method has a single parameter:
1. a JavaScript object to be converted into a JSON string

The function returns a JSON string.
