# Questions
- Are we using PostgreSQL, Prisma and Next.js?

# Database

## Setup
- on whose profile on Vercel should we make the PostgreSQL database?
- who should have access to it?
- 

# Prisma 
## Prisma Schema
### Models

What we are unsure about in the Poll model:
- quorum - is it in the MVP? Which form does it have (number of people, )
- endCondition - what are the end conditions for the MVP?
- anonymity - what are the anonymity options for the MVP?
- type - what are the poll types for the MVP?
How long are the results of a poll visible? do we want to delete them from the database after some time after they are closed? Is that something that can be defined while creating the poll?
